# LootThenFight
A simple game i made trying to test how good I am with Java and also cuz I was bored.
Feel free to add more weapons or change it in anyway that suites your needs. If you use it then if I could get some credit then that would be great. 
Disclaimer: I do not own any of the WAV files, I just got them off youtube and clipped them for the fun of it. 

To be able to run the code make sure that you get a WAV music file with whatever battle music you want and name it SAO and put that file in a folder with all the code.
